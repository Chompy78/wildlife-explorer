# short reminder; the agent decides whether the current task warrants pulling it in.

[ai-lessons-learned] A private, cross-project repo of durable AI-coding lessons exists at
chompy78/ai-lessons-learned (not automatically in this session's GitHub scope). If this
session's task touches a general engineering pattern, gotcha, or lesson that isn't specific
to Wildlife Explorer, call add_repo(owner="chompy78", repo="ai-lessons-learned"), clone it,
and read INDEX.md before proceeding. Otherwise, ignore this.
